# Single Process Scraper
## Setup the Scraper
First Clone this repo to the desired path 

``` C:\Users\*Desired Path*> git clone https://github.com/ShawnP1337/AMS.git```

## Install a Virtual Enviornment (venv) in the same path as the AMS repo

``` C:\Users\*Path to the Virtual Enviornment*> python -m venv venv  ```

Once the Virtual Enviornment is Created, directory should look something like this
